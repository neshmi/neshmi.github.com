<h2>about me</h2>
<p>Perhaps I'm confused.  Perhaps not.  I'm an anthropological archaeologist and a Rubyist.  It is hard to say which one I love more.  Right now, I combine these two passions in my life, using my love of programming, technology and electronics to aid in archaeological fieldwork.  This can make for a more objective science in the field and aid in open data sharing back home.  I authored [OpenDig](http://www.opendig.org) to help with the field collection which now has taken form in the way of three different applications, a full Ruby on Rails application, a CouchApp, and an iOS application.  As more tools are created they will be posted to this space.  Stay tuned!!</p>
